                <h1>Saint Thérèse (Littleflower)</h1>
                <p>Thérèse was the youngest of nine children, 
                    five of whom survived childhood. After her mother died of breast cancer in 1877,
                     Thérèse moved with her family to Lisieux. In the deeply religious atmosphere of her home,
                      her piety developed early and intensively.
                       All four of her elder sisters became nuns, and at the age of 15 she entered the Carmelite convent at Lisieux, having been refused admission a year earlier.
                        Although she suffered from depression, scruples a causeless feeling of guilt and,
                         at the end, religious doubts,
                          she kept the rule to perfection and maintained a smiling,
                           pleasant, and unselfish manner.
                            Before her death from tuberculosis,
                             she acknowledged that, because of her difficult nature,
                         not one day had ever passed without a struggle. 
                         Her burial site at Lisieux became a place of pilgrimage,
                          and a basilica bearing her name was built there (1929–54).</p>
